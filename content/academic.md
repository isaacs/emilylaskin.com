# Academic Work

I used to be an academic. Here's what I wrote back then.

* _[Tulips in Bloom: An Anthology of Modern Central Asian
  Literature](/s/TulipsInBloom.pdf)_, Palgrave MacMillan 2025.

  I helped edit this work, the first of its kind, and I also have
  a translation from the Persian in it.

* "[Geography, Genre, and Narrative in Kipling's
  _Kim_](/s/Laskin-Geography-and-Genre-in-Kim-Novel-202105.pdf),"
  _Novel: A Forum on Fiction_ May 2021

* A couple of

  [reviews](/s/Laskin_review-of-Khalid-Central-Asia_JAS.pdf)

* ["Toward a Theory of Second-World
  Literature,"](https://www.modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/laskin-toward-theory-second-world-lit-aini-reminiscences)

  Handbook of Global Romantic Literature and Culture_ 2026

* [_Geopoetics and Geopolitics_](/s/Laskin_dissertation.pdf), my
  doctoral dissertation

* My [application](/s/mellonacls-description-4.docx) for the
  selective Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship, which
  I won. Lift anything you'd like to from its structure or style,
  but please don't use my ideas without crediting me.

* My academic [CV](/s/Laskin_CV-academic.docx) as of its last
  update.
