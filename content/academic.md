# Academic Work

I used to be an academic. Here's what I wrote back then.

_Tulips in Bloom: An Anthology of Modern Central Asian Literature_, Palgrave MacMillan 2025. 
I helped edit this work, the first of its kind, and I also have a translation from the Persian in it.

"Geography, Genre, and Narrative in Kiplin's _Kim_," _Novel: A Forum on Fiction_ May 2021

A couple of book reviews

["Toward a Theory of Second-World Literature,"](https://www.modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/laskin-toward-theory-second-world-lit-aini-reminiscences) _Modernism/modernity_ July 2025

"Steppe Realism: Nikolai Karazin's _Two-Legged Wolf_," forthcoming in _The Bloomsbury Handbook of Global Romantic Literature and Culture_ 2026

_Geopoetics and Geopolitics_, my doctoral dissertation

My application for the selective Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship, which I won. Lift anything you'd like to from its structure or style, but please don't use my ideas without crediting me.

My academic CV as of its last update.
