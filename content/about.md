# About

 I'm a general-purpose wordcel! 

I used to work for the English edition of Meduza, Russia's premier independent newspaper-in-exile. 

## Here's some original reporting I did there:

[‘Everybody turned their backs on us’](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/12/10/everybody-turned-their-backs-on-us) An ongoing crisis at TV Rain sparked intense debate about Russian independent media, its allegiances, and its responsibilities

## Here's some news coverage by me that's gotten a lot of clicks:

[Was Azerbaijan Airlines Embraer jet shot down?](https://meduza.io/en/cards/was-azerbaijan-airlines-embraer-jet-shot-down) Marks on the plane’s exterior suggest it was hit by military air defenses. Meduza considers the evidence.
